Process Student Scores from a File




Problem 
* You are given a text file named students.txt that contains student names and their scores in the format:
        Eg format:
                John,85  
Alice,92  
Bob,abc  
. . . 
* Each line has two values: a student name and a score out of 100, separated by a comma.
Task
1. Read each line from students.txt using a loop.
2. Validate the data:
   * Name should not be empty.
   * Score must be a number between 0 and 100.
3. Handle invalid data using try-except blocks.
4. Write the output to a new file results.txt in the format:
   * E.g format <results.txt> file:
      * <Name> : Valid score = <score>
      * <Name> : Invalid score (non-numeric)
      * <Name> : Invalid score (out of range)
      * <Name> : Invalid score (missing name)
5. At the end, print on the console:
   * Total valid entries
   * Total invalid entries




NOTE: students.txt file attached present in the drive shared.
