# SSPL Internship – Daily Learnings & Tasks

This repository contains my daily work, learnings, and tasks completed during my internship at **Sculpt Soft Pvt. Ltd. (SSPL)**.  
Each folder is named according to the date (`DD_Mon_YY`) and contains two subfolders – **Learnings** and **Tasks** – to clearly separate self-learning exercises from assigned internship work.


## 📌 Purpose
This repository is built to:
- Maintain a daily log of my internship activities
- Clearly organize **learning materials** and **assigned tasks**
- Make it easier to review progress over time
- Serve as a personal knowledge base
