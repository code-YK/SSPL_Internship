Employee Management System
________________


Objective
Practice core OOP concepts in Python: inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstract classes, static and class methods, and package structuring.
________________


Task Description
* Create an abstract Employee class with name, _employee_id, and __base_salary.
* Implement Developer and Manager classes (single inheritance) overriding calculate_salary().
* Create a CTO class using multiple inheritance (inherits from both). Use super() to handle salary calculation.
* Create a Payroll class with:
   * Class variable: company_name
   * Class method: change_company_name()
   * Static method: greet()
   * Instance method: process_payroll() that loops through employees and prints salaries (demonstrating polymorphism).
* Organize code into company/ package (employees.py, payroll.py).
